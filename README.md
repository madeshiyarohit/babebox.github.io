## Project Name : **Babebox Homepage !**

In this project i have created a replica of Babebox Homepage from scratch. And i have learnt a lot of things like how to use flex and how css makes life easier , we can manipulate the things in Html with the help of CSS without touching HTML file in terms of positing and direction not in terms of DOM manipulation😅. In this project i have also learnt that how to use js libraries and i have used one of them Which is AOS.
